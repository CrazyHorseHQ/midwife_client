#Overview

This page provides details on the data fields that help define the resources or objects that SMART is built to serve.

The names of the fields represent the corresponding columns in the database and are identical to the name of the fields in each API call.

While we will try to keep this up-to-date, discrepancies will inevitably kick in. We'd like to ask that if you find a discrepancy or inaccuracies, then please let us know at [The Product Works](http://www.theproduct.works/about-us/)
